# DotFiles

DotFiles for my various systems.  Starting with bash startups but will expand to include other config files.

* Subfolder for each system. 
* Common items such as bash aliases should be included from a single file at the top level.
* Scripts should never fail so include checks to ensure safety. (e.g. check file exists before sourcing).

Files should be sym-linked to the repository from their correct location on each system.

# ToDo

* Add systems:
	* RPi (raspbmc, raspbian)
	* Old Laptop (Linux Mint) 
	* Home Desktop (XUbuntu)
* Add other files
	* conkyrc from Linux machines
