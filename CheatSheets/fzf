# fzf fuzzy finder https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the selected item to STDOUT.

find * -type f | fzf > selected

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files excluding hidden ones.

## Search syntax

Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in "extended-search mode" where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. 
e.g. ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire

Token       Match type                  Description
---         ---                         ---
sbtrkt      fuzzy-match                 Items that match sbtrkt
'wild       exact-match (quoted)        Items that include wild
^music      prefix-exact-match          Items that start with music
.mp3$       suffix-exact-match          Items that end with .mp3
!fire       inverse-exact-match         Items that do not include fire
!^music     inverse-prefix-exact-match  Items that do not start with music
!.mp3$      inverse-suffix-exact-match  Items that do not end with .mp3

If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" every word, start fzf with -e or --exact option. 
Note that when --exact is set, '-prefix "unquotes" the term.

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. 
For example, the following query matches entries that start with core and end with either go, rb, or py.

^core go$ | rb$ | py$
